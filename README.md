# 🎯 Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering / Matrix Factorization

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to build a **Recommendation System** that predicts user preferences using **Collaborative Filtering** or **Matrix Factorization** techniques. It showcases how to personalize recommendations based on user-item interactions.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement a recommendation engine using collaborative filtering or matrix factorization.
- Train and evaluate the model using appropriate metrics.
- Provide item recommendations tailored to individual users.

## 📁 Deliverable

A fully functional **Jupyter Notebook or application** demonstrating:
- Data loading and preprocessing.
- Model implementation (e.g., ALS, SVD).
- Recommendation output and performance evaluation (e.g., RMSE, Precision@K).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas / NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Surprise / LightFM / TensorFlow Recommenders  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Streamlit or Flask (optional, for app interface)  
- Jupyter Notebook
